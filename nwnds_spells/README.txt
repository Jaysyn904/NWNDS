Colorized Spell Icons

There are two independant files associated with this collection.  The first .rar contains a hak file that can be included in building your module so that anybody that plays will have the new icons.  The second is all 345 of the icons in another .rar file that can be decompressed and placed in your NWN override folder so that you have them with every module you play, whether on your machine or online.  You only need one of these files, but having both will not cause any problems.

As an experiment, I began colorizing some of the spell icons for my PW project based on basic themes of the various spells.  I ended up doing all of them that I could find, and they are roughly categorized as:

dark blue		cold and water spells
brown			earth, stone, and metal spells
light aqua		air and force based spells
bright green		acid spells
orange			fire spells
white			sound based spells
gold			good, healing, light, and positive energy spells
indigo			general protective, dispelling, and warding spells
cyan			electricity spells
red			evil, negative energy, and just plain nasty spells
dark green		nature, plant, and animal based spells
yellow-green		planar based spells
grey			illusion and shadow based spells (also a catch-all for odd spells like grease)
magenta			personal and item enhancing spells
spectrum		color spells (all two of them: prismatic spray and color spray)
blue-to-yellow-to-blue	divination spells
blue-to-orange		transformation spells
orange-yellow-orange	epic spells

Enjoy.
