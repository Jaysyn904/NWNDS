Hulking insect-men standing as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder, tohr-kreen & thri-kreen are the least "human" of the player character races. Their survivability in the wilderness, combined with their cunning and intellect, have made the mantis warriors (as they are known to some races) the undisputed masters across large tracts of the Athasian wastes.

When still, a Tondi looks like a giant Ohi Flower, or an outcropping of rock crystal. Tondi often lay eggs near Ohi Flowers, found in Northern Scrub Plains. Adults often live in gardens of Ohi Flowers, or in rocky badlands of the North, where there are outcroppings of rock crystal. All Tondi are female, and they reproduce by parthenogenesis, laying eggs that hatch into more females. Tondi tend to be neutral with regards to good and evil. Most love nature and are skilled herbalists, almost every Tondi who follows a profession becomes a druid. Rare in the North, Tondi are completely unknown in the tablelands; still, it is rumored that Durwadala, the kreen druid of the Lost Oasis, is a Tondi.
