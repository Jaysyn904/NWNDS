Dwarves are short but extremely powerful.  Athasian Dwarves average 4 1/2 to 5 feet in height and tend to have a very large muscle mass - a full grown dwarf weighs in the neighborhood of 200 pounds.  Lives of hard work in the hot sun leave them with a rich tan and rugged, callused hands and feet.  Dwarves can live up to 250 years.

A dwarf's chief love is toil.  A dwarf is never happier than when there is a cause to work or fight for, something he can approach with stoic single-mindedness for weeks, months, years or even decades at a time.  Once a dwarf's mind is committed to a certain task, he'll only set it aside after a great deal of grumbling and coercion.  The fulfillment he achieves upon completion of a lengthy, difficult task is what he strives for.

The task to which a dwarf is presently committeed is referred to as his focus.  A dwarf's focus must be a feat requiring at least one week to complete.  Shorter term goals cannot be considered a focus.  A dwarf's commitment to his focus is based in his physiology - those who complete their lives before their foci live out their afterlives as banshees in the wastes, haunting their unfinished works!

An Athasian dwarf takes notice of other beings based upon his focus.  If the other being is also actively committed to the dwarf's focusm the dwarf will consider him a sensible and dependable companion.  If, however, the other being is vehemently opposed to the dwarf's focus, the two will be irrevocably at odds until one or the other is dead.  There is very little room for compromise in the mind of a dwarf.
