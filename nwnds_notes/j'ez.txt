Hulking insect-men standing as tall as 7 feet at the shoulder, tohr-kreen & thri-kreen are the least "human" of the player character races. Their survivability in the wilderness, combined with their cunning and intellect, have made the mantis warriors (as they are known to some races) the undisputed masters across large tracts of the Athasian wastes.

The J'ez are a black-colored subrace of the tohr-kreen, probably closely related to the To'ksa, as they share the leathery skin over their chitin as well as long antennae. Aside from their color, their most unique feature is their mouth; a circular orifice ringed with inward-pointing fangs and with mobile mouth-parts used to assist with eating. They are an aggressive species, culturally fond of combat, but also highly intelligent; they make up a large part of the tohr-kreen philosophers and military leaders, and highly prize reading.
