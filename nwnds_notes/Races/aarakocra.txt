Of all the aarakocra who live beneath Athas's crimson sun, only the silvaarak of the White Mountains can be used as player characters. The bird-people who leave Winter Nest to become player characters are seen as young rebels by the rest of their community. They are adventurous, seeking higher purpose and a way to help the beleaguered world. In all cases, aarakocra have a deep and abiding respect for the gifts of nature and little patience for those who abuse those gifts.

As beings intimately connected to high mountain peaks and the open sky, aarakocra have a great love of freedom. In some ways, this love is even more intense than a similar emotion experienced by elves. They prefer to always be above a situation, either flying or perched above the rest of a group so that they can have a bird's-eye view. Aarakocra are claustrophobic and will only enter an enclosed building or cave if absolutely necessary.
