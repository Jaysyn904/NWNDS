#1 - Most fitting for battle music, dungeon area, non-boss. Most akin to a city scene or sewers.
#2 - Suited for maybe a hideout? Bandit hiseout / theif's guild / something hidden in a city scene. Pairs great with #1.
#3 - Being post-apoc... I could this being used in the desolate plains or roads when traveling. It feels like travel music to me.
#4 - Has a wind / thunder element. Could be the mountains, hills, dragon's lair perhaps? Definitely a traditional RPG type of track in nature.
#5 - Pairs extremely well with #3 as either an alternative travel track or maybe the battle track for those areas.
#6 - I very much get ocean / beach vibes from this... so it'd be great to pair where any oceans are. If not, then lake areas would also do nicely (even if the water is silt now).
#7 - Dungeon music, no doubt about it. It's safe to fit into any dungeon you want really - goblins to giants.
#8 - Pairs great with #4 as the more calm version. This could be the travel and #4 the battle music or simply two similar areas. Also has a flute for desert-like mountains or the like.
#9 - Travel / Dungeon music... maybe something like a mountain trial or desert road? Would be great for that.
#10 - Could be battle music or more epic travelling music for one of the "epic" areas of the server, wherever that might be. It has an intense but also chill undertone to it.
#11 - This is straight up creepy music mixed with epic buildup. This would be fantastic for a crypt crawling with undead or something similar.
#12 - Very chill track... might be good for the general cities/villages/safe havens or the like.
#13 - Dungeon music I'd say, non-battle.
#14 - This would work good for a tavern / inn!
#15 - Another track for a safe place - tavern, blacksmith, general shop, etc.
#16 - Gives me more of a desert vibe than anything else, honestly... but could shift it to anywhere with high winds. Definitely a road area or somewhere that has danger though.
#17 - Some sort of official government building, or guard building, sorcerer-king castle, etc.
#18 - Super, super change of pace for the tracks... it almost doesn't fit with the feel of the setting. I can only imagine if there is like a grove or forest area that is VERY well preserved?
#19 - This feels like a dangerous, but secret place - maybe a hidden vault or dungeon around the sorcerer-king's castles/places.
#20 - Peaceful travel music, but certainly has a better place than #18 - maybe a road that's not well traveled and has no enemies?
#21 - Very subtle at first, pretty creepy music. I'd place it somewhere you want to jar the players with a track of little music. Has a lot of breathing too, so maybe a lair?
#22 - Very subtle as well but less ominous breathing and more just a faint rumbling.
#23 - A little more obvious than #22, but still pretty ominous. Pair it with rain sounds and it'd be great for a serious / dangerous / creepy scene.
#24 - Absolutely somewhere that has a lot of dead ghosts/souls/undead of some sort. I'd actually suggest not having battle music and have this play throughout.
#25 - Same as #24 with a few flavor changes.
#26 - Definitely dark music. Think demons, rituals, monsters, undead. With the right sounds and visuals, you can make hairs stand up with this one. It is short though.
#27 - Same as #26 with a few flavor changes.
#28 - Of the same vien as track #22, but more drip-like sounds? Maybe blood or just someone (or something) walking the halls.
#29 - Like track #28, but more sounds added.
#30 - Similar to #29, but added moans of the dead! Spooky.
#31 - Moans of the dead, screams, those big gong sounds... also added wind. Feels like walking into the belly of the beast for me.
#32 - Like Track #22, but louder.
#33 - Pretty subtle, delayed sounds of echoing bells of some sort.
#34 - Bird calls with monster sounds - would be good for an open road and dead bodies strung about.
#35 - I personally think anything with dialogue should not be included anywhere - which this has sadly. Otherwise it'd be a desert battle scene to me.
#36 - More dialogue. Not really a music track.
#37 - More dialogue. Too much to make a proper music track.
#38 - Those eerie moans and screams again... that's about it though. Could be nice for a crypt or something.
#39 - This is a little bit of everything it sounds like, haha. Glad you found a home for it. Not sure about the yelling though, myself. Oh... and the happy ending dialogue.
