On Athas, the fighter is a trained warrior, a soldier skilled in mass warfare.  Every society on Athas maintains an army of fighters to protect itself from an attack or to wage wars of plunder and annihilation against its neighbors.  Fighters are both the comanders and soldiers in these armies, and at higher levels are experts in both individual and formation combat, leadership, and morale.  The desperate populations of Athas are constantly on the lookout for great commanders; warriors who will lead them on campaigns of glory.

From the small forts in sandy wastes of Athas to the guards of the merchant houses in the city-states, fighters are Athas' most common sight.  Whether it is as mercenaries for the sorcerer-kings or as hired guards protecting the wealth of the nobility, fighters can be found everywhere in the Tablelands.  Athas' fighters are trained to fight in small groups or huge units.  Those that have proven themselves become the commanders in the city-states' armies, commanding hundreds or even thousands of men into war.
