Gladiators are the slave warriors of the city states, specially trained for brutal physical contests.  Disciplined in many diverse forms of hand-to-hand combat and skilled in the use of dozens of different weapons, gladiators are the most dangerous warriors on Athas.  The arena is the battlefield of the gladiator.  From hand-to-hand combat in the mud pits of small forts to the grand games of the city-states, the gladiator is a warrior who fights to the sounds of people cheering his name or cursing his presence.

A master of crowd control and the art of prolonged combat, gladiators are trained to fight.  They train to best wild beasts in deadly games for the amusement of the masses.  They fight for glory, wealth, prestige and power.  They fight to survive.  Some are merely slaves, having to fight and perhaps hoping to win a chance to obtain freedom, while some fight willingly for the thrill of combat or the promise of riches and fame.
