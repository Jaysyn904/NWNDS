Athas is a world without deities. Powerful sorcerer-kings often masquerade as gods and demigods but, though their powers are great and their worshippers many, they are not true gods. The world does, however, provide sources of magical power. Druids associate themselves with the spirits that inhabit special geographical locations on Athas. Every oasis, rock formation, stretch of desert, and mountain has a spirit that looks over it and protects its use. A druid will ally with a particular spirit, acting as that spirit's earthly counterpart, drawing his magical energy from the spirit in question.

Druids are independent priests who ally themselves with various spirits of the land. He shares power with the spirit he worships, nurturing and protecting the geographical feature to which the spirit is tied. Virtually every feature of the land on Athas has a druid to protect it, but there is no worldwide organization of druids-they serve independently, living patient, solitary lives of guardianship.
