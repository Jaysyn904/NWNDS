`The Hill` - This maze-like cave system is accessible from the Western Dunes & currently leads to Underhill.  This area will be easy enough to leave in place & turn into a humanoid lair or cave system to explore

`Underhill` - This small lava-filled dungeon area is/was the lair of a non-canon, non-pnp legal boss, `The Doomlord`.  This area lead back to the `Western Dunes` or you can take the portal to the 'Ethereal Enclave - Emotional Abattior'.  This ares is problematic as-is, in several different ways.

`Ethereal Enclave - Carnal Forge` - This is a lava filled non-canon epic area connects to the western door from 'Ethereal Enclave - Temple From Within`. Home to the made up epic boss Lizard person `Varun Marya`.  A lot of non-canon fire based & demonic enemies.

'Ethereal Enclave - Emotional Abattior' - This epic area is supposed to be an illithid cell secreted away on the Ethereal plane.  The only way to get here is from `Ethereal Enclave - Enigma Rift` & the only other area transition is a portal that leads back to `Underhill`.  This are is full of epic illithid & a few non-canon beholders.

`Ethereal Enclave - Enigma Rift` - This epic area is much like 'Ethereal Enclave - Emotional Abattior' that proceeds it, except it's bigger,  has more treasure & includes an `Elder Brain` boss that needs to be re-made to make PnP legal.

`Ethereal Enclave - Hell Hole` - This liminary area sits between `Abandoned Town - Abandoned Shop` & `Ethereal Enclave - Temple From Within`.  A `nightmare beast` lairs here, but the area will need to be made larger (and more lair like) for the new `nightmare beast` model.

`Ethereal Enclave - Life Ending Path` - Another ill-fitting epic area reachable from `Ethereal Enclave - Temple From Within`.  This small dungeon is full of traps and a lot of non-canon monsters, including a boss called the `Nightmare Lord`. This area leads to `Ethereal Enclave - Womb of Chaos`.

`Ethereal Enclave - Mortal Coil` - Another firey epic area, this one has mostly PnP legal elementals & other fire themed creatures spawning here.  The phylactery doesn't nothing.  The western door `Ethereal Enclave - Temple From Within` leads here.  

`Ethereal Enclave - Temple From Within` - This tiny area is reachable from `Ethereal Enclave - Hell Hole` & is a hub between `Ethereal Enclave - Carnal Forge`, Ethereal Enclave - Mortal Coil` & `Ethereal Enclave - Womb of Chaos`.  Nothing lives here, but beware of the randomized traps.

`Ethereal Enclave - Womb of Chaos` - This is the lair of `Tulmult the Soul Collector` who I guess is supposed to be some kind of undead true fire drake with defiler levels.  `Greater Boneyards` spawn here as well as two very out of place `prismasauruses`.
