A few notes about compiling:

There are a bunch of batch files at the nwnprc/ module root. These are your interface to the build system.
The makefile depends on a machine-specific file called config.make. This file specifies the location of NWN
on the current system and the PRC version string.

#begin example config.make
NWN_DIR = E:\NeverWinterNights\NWN
PRC_VERSION = 23a
PRC_INSTALLVERSION = 2.3a
#end example config.make


The batch files:

clean.bat - Cleans all object files. Use after drastic changes to make sure no old cruft lies around. Also always to be used before building a release.

make.bat  - Builds the makefile and then runs it

buildmake.bat - Builds the makefile
runmake.bat   - Runs a pre-built makefile



By default, the build process compiles each of the scripts. The scripts are then packaged into haks that are placed
under CompiledResources. The erfs are similarly built and placed under CompiledResources.
The tlk.xml file is converted into a tlk file.
These generated files are also installed into their respective subdirectories under your NWN directory.
