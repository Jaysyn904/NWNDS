Dagger

"A knife is not a weapon of war.  A knife is a tool of survival.

For most intelligent species on Athas, having or not having a knife is the difference in being able to prepare wood for a fire, skins for clothing, food for consumption, or even wounds for dressing.  While as serviceable as any other short, sharp object when it comes to the art of amateur bloodletting, remember that the knife is a tool of utility first, and a weapon of violence second, and act accordingly.

This particular specimen, however, is not a tool.  Front toward enemy, clean after use."
