Tareks are muscle-bound brutes that are known for their great constitution and will to live. They look dull-witted, with their squared heads with sloping foreheads, and are about as smart as the average half-giant. Their features lend them a fearsome presence that has earned them a well-deserved reputation as dangerous foes. Tareks have a distinct musky odor that can be detected from as far away as 30 ft.
